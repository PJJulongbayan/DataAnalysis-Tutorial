# DataAnalysis-Tutorial

This repository showcases Python code examples for conducting data analysis in Python over several exercise files (.py and ipynb) - from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, basic charting, and simple linear regression. However, please note that the files within this repository do not contain deployment-level solutions. This repository is intended for educational purposes and is not a deployment-grade repository.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Python3 and a code editor installed in your system along with the following packages and libraries:
1. Data processing, analysis and manipulation: Pandas, numpy,csv, json
2. Visualization and Charting: Matplotlib and seaborn
3. Basic linear regression: Scikit-learn and scipy

## Contents 

1. Scratch codes on simple data analysis and reading and saving different files in python
2. Exploratory data analysis on Cars and Laptops dataset
3. Linear Regression on Cars and Laptops dataset
4. Mini-project to predict real estate house prices (putting it all together)

## Dataset 
1. Dataset are fetched directly in the code as they might change in content and form depending on the exercise.
2. Primarily, data on insurance, cars, laptop, and house prices are used.
